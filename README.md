Json is one of the ways you can represent any data in text form.
This data storage format is used in Java script, but it has become popular and is used in other modern programming languages.
This program can take any data, for example, an array of data, and add that data to a .json file. 
There are functions in my program that do the work of adding the .json file, clearing it, saving and loading it.
